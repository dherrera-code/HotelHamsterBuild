 // Hamster Hotel!

 // For this assignment, I re-created the Hamster Hotel website based on the prototype provided and implemented responsiveness for the tablet version and a mobile version!

 // You can add multiple dates with description.
 Fix: tablet mode where rooms cards section is stacked vertically at tablet and lower.
 Add links to the navbar to navigate to the appropriate spot .

// Peer Review: Jesus Salgado: The layout mimics the "figma" for the most part but when you are in tablet the "rooms" section is staggering a bit with 2 cards on top and 1 card below those. Try to make them stack vertically at tablet and lower, i see it works on mobile so it shouldn't be too difficult to do that. I see that you got rid of almost all of the images once you got to mobile size. Since you have the navbar I would suggest adding the links and linking them so when you click the links on the navbar it actually takes you to the section. Otherwise great job sir!
